## 💸 Infrastructure Freeze & Recovery Plan

Creepy was ready to launch. The dashboard works. The wiki’s live. The bot logic is tested. But GCloud froze our infrastructure over a $200 overdue bill — cutting off VM access and API calls mid-rollout.

We’re raising **$600 USD** to:
- 🔓 Unfreeze the VM and restore full service  
- 🧮 Cover the next billing cycle for stable hosting  
- 🚀 Launch the public beta and activate Creepy PRO

Once we reach **$250**, we unlock:
- ✅ Gemini CLI access and $1000 in untouched GenAI credit  
- ✅ Requalification for Google Cloud’s startup program  
- ✅ Restoration of thecreepy.app and full dashboard access

## 🖼️ Screenshots & Visuals

These assets document the current state of the platform and recovery effort:

* ![GCloud Startup Review](./gcloud_startup.png) – Application screenshot for Google Cloud for Startups  
* ![Moonshot Screenshot](./moon_shot.png) – Visual from the Gemini-powered dashboard  
* ![Live Page Overview](./overview1.png) – Frozen landing page from thecreepy.app  
* ![Creepy PRO Preview](./pro_preview..png) – Subscription UI with GPay integration

GPay integration has been approved via API, but payment routing to the wallet is pending setup. Once infrastructure is restored, we’ll finalize the payment link and enable direct subscriptions. PayPal and Revolut API integration are planned post-recovery.
