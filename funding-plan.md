# 🧮 Creepy Funding Breakdown

## 🎯 Goal: $600 USD

This funding covers the recovery and relaunch of the Creepy bot infrastructure, currently frozen due to overdue GCloud billing.

---

## 🔹 Phase 1: Unfreeze Services ($200–$250)

- 🔓 Pay overdue GCloud VM and Gemini CLI API usage  
- 💡 Unlock access to untouched GenAI trial credit (~$1000)  
- 🧠 Enable Wiki RAG indexing to offload VM RAM and reduce hosting cost  
- 🧪 Resume Gemini CLI quota for debugging and compiling Creepy PRO  
- 🧰 Gemini Code Assistant Enterprise Edition bundle (~$45)

Once paid, services should unfreeze automatically, restoring access to the VM, Gemini CLI, and GenAI credits for wiki and backend optimization.

## 🔹 Phase 2: Stabilize Hosting ($200)

- 🧮 Cover next GCloud billing cycle  
- 🛠 Ensure stable hosting during public beta rollout  
- 🧵 Maintain Gemini CLI access for closed testing with selected Discord communities

---

## 🔹 Phase 3: Buffer & Transparency ($100)

- 🧯 Reserve for unexpected traffic spikes, webhook load, or Firebase overages  
- 📢 Keep sponsors updated on progress and milestones  
- 🎁 Explore sponsor rewards and visibility options

---

## 👥 Sponsor Visibility & Rewards

If configured properly, GitHub Sponsors will display a list of supporters. While this increases transparency, it may raise privacy concerns for some contributors.

I’ll explore:
- ✅ Optional shoutouts in the Creepy Wiki or dashboard  
- 🎖️ Early access to Creepy PRO features  
- 🧾 Private updates on infrastructure progress and roadmap execution

## 💬 Final Note
This isn’t just about covering a bill — it’s about unlocking a frozen infrastructure, activating untouched GenAI credits, and pushing Creepy into public beta with full Gemini integration.

Every contribution helps restore momentum and requalify for Google Cloud’s startup program, where Creepy could stands out as a Gemini-powered case study built entirely through AI tooling and solo execution.

Sponsors will be kept in the loop with transparent updates, and I’ll make sure your support is acknowledged — whether privately, publicly, or directly inside the product.

You’re not just funding a bot. You’re backing a founder who builds with precision, documents every step, and delivers.
