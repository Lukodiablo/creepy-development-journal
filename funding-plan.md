# 🧮 Creepy Funding Breakdown

## 🎯 Goal: $600 USD

This funding covers the recovery and relaunch of the Creepy bot infrastructure, currently frozen due to overdue GCloud billing.

---

## 🔹 Phase 1: Unfreeze Services ($200–$250)

- 🔓 Pay overdue GCloud VM and Gemini CLI API usage  
- 💡 Unlock access to untouched GenAI trial credit (~$1000)  
- 🧠 Enable Wiki RAG indexing to offload VM RAM and reduce hosting cost  
- 🧪 Resume Gemini CLI quota for debugging and compiling Creepy PRO  
- 🧰 Gemini Code Assistant Enterprise Edition bundle (~$45)

Once paid, services should unfreeze automatically, restoring access to the VM, Gemini CLI, and GenAI credits for wiki and backend optimization.

## 🔹 Phase 2: Stabilize Hosting ($200)

- 🧮 Cover next GCloud billing cycle  
- 🛠 Ensure stable hosting during public beta rollout  
- 🧵 Maintain Gemini CLI access for closed testing with selected Discord communities

---

## 🔹 Phase 3: Buffer & Transparency ($100)

- 🧯 Reserve for unexpected traffic spikes, webhook load, or Firebase overages  
- 📢 Keep sponsors updated on progress and milestones  
- 🎁 Explore sponsor rewards and visibility options

## 👥 Sponsor Visibility & Rewards

If configured properly, GitHub Sponsors will display a list of supporters. While this increases transparency, it may raise privacy concerns for some contributors.

I’ll explore:
- ✅ Optional shoutouts in the Creepy Wiki or dashboard  
- 🎖️ Early access to Creepy PRO features  
- 🧾 Private updates on infrastructure progress and roadmap execution

## 💬 Final Note

Every contribution helps unlock the infrastructure and push Creepy into public beta. Sponsors will be kept in the loop, and I’ll make sure your support is acknowledged — whether publicly or privately.
